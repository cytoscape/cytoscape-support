This is a special package designed to allow objects that are normally
provided as OSGi services to be created without an OSGi environment
for unit testing purposes.  This allows unit tests to be run without
a lot of overhead and at the same time allows unit tests to be written 
without explicitly depending on implementation code.

For example, instead of getting a CyNetworkFactory injected into your 
code using Spring+OSGi framework, just create a NetworkTestSupport object 
and and then call getNetwork() to get a CyNetwork object:

	...
	NetworkTestSupport support = new NetworkTestSupport();
	CyNetwork net = support.getNetwork();
	...

Of course, this code should NOT be used as a substitute for Spring+OSGi
in a production environment.
